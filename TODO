- Show the regex on the main page and eliminate the 'code' data structure.

Maybe have two tabs? One for the file selecttion with a Run button
that will only list filename. But later we'll want the file selection
to includ looking into files as well. So we rather want to be able
to control the output: unique filenames only,
or lines that matched (incl/excl filename),
or the matches only (incl/excl filename)...

- Allow creating configurable script.
  (E.g. one that gets a filename or a directory name on the command line)
- Even create GUI for such scripts?

- Select directory
     filter based on generic wilde-card

- Process any text file with regular expressions (replacing?)
- Support well known text formats (e.g. JSON/YAML/INI/Apache log/XML/HTML)
- Support well known binary formats (e.g. Spreadsheets)
- Select URL

- Allow the execution of the json files on the command line.
- Convert json files to perl script.

==============================================================
Use Cases:
- Select a directory
  - find files that match certain conditions
    file-name wilde-cards
    timestamp (older than, newer than)
    size (smaller than, larger than)
    last modified ...
    etc.
    has certain content in it (matching a regex?)

    For each such file do some action as below:

- Select a file
  - find lines matching a regex (and the negative)
    m/Foo/
  - replace strings by other strings
    s/Foo/Bar/
  - find strings matching a regex (\d+)
  - in a spreadsheet select column x
  - do some operation on the values (e.g. add them together)

- Convert Unix/Linux line endings.
- Convert encodings of a file.

- In a file containing subtitles
  - check if the timestamps are aligned correctly
    (no overlaps, no gaps)
  - update all the timestamps with a delay of +/- N seconds.
